          there are <em>so many</em> places that i haven't been, and so ten of my hundred achievements will be travel related. again, what counts as ticking-off worthy will be subject to judgement and overall vibes of the place.</br></p>

          this one is a DOUBLE SIZE goal category, meaning i've given myself 20 whole goal slots entirely dedicated to new skills, because i'm anticipating that there'll be times when i'm a little bit loose with the definition of 'learning a skill' and i just know i'll waste a tick box and wish i had more</p>

          if i'm GONNA spend a lot of my time sat at the computer, i might as well unlock the secrets inside? i love being a part of the tech world, and i feel that the future is going to need a whole lot of tech literacy.. and so here's where i'll start. as usual, these achievements are very <em>>loose</em>, and i'm hoping they'll also inspire the next set of achievements.</p>

          i would like to preface this section with an express disclaimer that this is <strong>not about weight loss</strong>. i have a lot of issues with body confidence, but i've done enough learning to know that my size isn't the cause of those issues, and that i was born into an inherintly fatphobic society. my fitness goals are about repairing my relationship with food, finding resilience to injury, and finding new hobbies that don't involve a screen.</p>

          i appear to have a set of traits that do not lend themselves well to organisation, such as reluctance to throw anything away ever, an inability to maintain helpful home life organisational systems, and a love for doing anything other than tidying. for the sake of being able to find anything, i would like to work on changing this - by working with myself to develop ways of keeping my life in some sort of order that allows me to safely have an acceptable level of disorder.. </p>

          you've no idea how many times i've sat down and tried to write these goals.. sometimes, i was finding far too many, sometimes they'd be too specific, sometimes i'd be feeling super down and not have any at all. i've tried to find a nice compromise in allowing myself wildcards - anything at all that i come across that is worthy of an achievement and doesn't seem to fit anywhere else, will live here.</p>
