        <p>
         I'd like to make one thing abundantly clear before we go any further: I am a <strong>firm</strong> believer that you are never too old, or too this, or too that. You can read a little bit more in depth about how I feel about the passage of time and life and how it relates to achievements in the blog post I haven't written yet, but in short, these goals are to help me decorate the passage of time in ways that I enjoy. They're not here to help me meet arbitrary or societally-imposed standards, they're simply a way of helping me to spend more time making the most of the time I have. 
         </p>
        </br>
        <p>
         I should also note, I've been very loose with these goals. There's eight categories: six of them have 10 goals in, and two of them have 20 goals in. However, in the true spirit of not wanting to limit myself, and also disovering that I'm <em>horrible</em> at goal-setting, a lot of the goals are either vibes-based or very vague, allowing me to take stock of any achievements and count them as a goal as long as they fit within a category. The starting point was 27th November, 2024, and eventually I'll code a cute little progress bar here somewhere, but for now, and in no particular order..
