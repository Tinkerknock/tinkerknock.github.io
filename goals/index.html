        <h2>Disclaimer: I've a very loose definition of the word 'goal'.. and apparently, a very loose definition of what achieving those goals looks like, too.</h2>
      </div>

      <div id="intro">
        <p>
        I'm hoping to write up a lovely and coherent blog post about the deeper through process behind these goals, but for now, I'll just leave you with a general introduction. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Below, you'll find a hundred 'goals', or something along those lines. Im actually omitting a very big cheat - I didn't think up a hundred goals. Not even close - I think there's actually something like.. well, I'll count a bit later. As I mentioned before, I've been quite loose with these goals. There's eight categories, in no particular order:
        </p>
        <p>
<ul>
  <li>Tech - 10 goals</li>
  <li>Organisation - 10 goals</li>
  <li>Fitness - 10 goals</li>
  <li>Reading - 10 goals</li>
  <li>Travel - 10 goals</li>
  <li>Wildcards - 10 goals</li>
  <li>Skills* - this is a double category, with 20 goals</li>
  <li>Crafts* - this is a double category, with 20 goals</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
In the true spirit of not wanting to limit myself, and having discovered that I am <em>horrible</em> at goal setting, a lot of the goals are either very vibes-based or very vague, and very much up to my own personal interpretation of whether I've achieved something. This allows me to factor in any unforseen skills that I may have had no prior knowledge that I'd learn, but can also allow for the encouragement to hunt out new things and move further out of my comfort zone and into the unknown. 
</p>
<p>
  In future, I will be coding a cute little progress bar here somewhere, and will also be digging out my Javascript knowledge to tidy this page up, but for now..

              I'd like to preface this section with a bold disclaimer that none of these are about weight loss as an achievement. I have my fair share of issues with body confidence and positivity, but I've been doing an awful lot to un-learn the fatphobia that society ingrained into me as a child and recognise that I am allowed to exist exactly as I am. These goals are about looking after the body I have, repairing my relationship with food, continuing to unlearn bad habits, finding resilience to injury, and finding new hobbies that don't involve a screen.</em>

<strong>READING:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>As a child, I loved reading. My weekends were spent at the library, my reading journal was always full, and I had hundreds of unfinished novel drafts on my home computer that were usually self-inserts about the stables I'd run that bore a striking similarity to the Heartland series that I was obsessed with. I still do love reading, but I find that I don't make enough time for it, and I don't put enough effort into reading diverse works. All too often I find myself sitting on my phone before bed, doomscrolling, giving myself thumb problems and ending the day comparing myself to a random stranger on the internet when actually, I could be reading? Even though fantasy/romantasy is my favourite, I also want to make sure I'm reading non-fiction too. Five of each can't be that hard?</em>

            <em>I cannot even begin to detail how many times I've tried to sit down and write these goals, and on how many platforms! Miro, Trello, Notebook, a Discord group I used to moderate, the piece of paper that I thought was scrap but was actually important information regarding my pension.. the list goes on. I was finding that I'd made them too specific, or they'd been written with my current mood in mind and weren't reflective of anything that was actually possible, or I'd look at them with fresh eyes and hate them all. I've tried to find myself a nice compromise by allowing myself these wildcards - anything at all that I achieve that doesn't really fit anywhere else, will live here.</em>
