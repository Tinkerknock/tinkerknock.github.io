            THIS IS A DUMP FOR THE THINGS I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO PUT YET! 
            
            I've always been a little funny about birthdays, and it's almost always been about the passage of time, and how little control I have over it. I always feel some sort of dread, some sense of loss, some deeply unsettling     
            </p>


          Since I concluded that I couldn't in good faith count 'think of goals' as an actual goal within this 100 goal total, I decided that 'goal one' would be to not only think up the 99 others, but to build a website to house them all. That very website is the one you're visiting right now, and is a wonderfully broken and basic work in progress that has built upon a solid coding foundation that I developed when I was around ten years old and first discovered Neopets. I spend an awful lot of my life on the computer, and so learning to speak their language was a natural first port of call when considering what I'd like to achieve. 
          </p>
          <p>
          I'm hoping that this site will evolve as I do, and can grow from just a lowly bug-ridden goal dump and become a portolio of sorts, containing all the evidence of my personal growth and serving as a beacon of hope for anybody else who feels like time was leaving them behind. 
          </p>
          <p>
          In conclusion, hi, I'm Savannah (or Tinkerknock, as I'm known online), and I'm working on this site. And myself. In 100 different ways.
