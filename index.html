      <div id="intro">
        <p>
          In late 2024 I turned 30, and I set myself a goal: think up 99 <em>more</em> goals, and then spend the next however-long working towards ticking them all off as part of my everyday life.
         </p> 
         <p>
          Since I concluded that I couldn't in good faith count 'think of goals' as an actual goal within this 100 goal total, I decided that 'goal one' would be to not only think up the 99 others, but to build a website to house them all. That very website is the one you're visiting right now, and is a wonderfully broken and basic work in progress that has built upon a solid coding foundation that I developed when I was around ten years old and first discovered Neopets. I spend an awful lot of my life on the computer, and so learning to speak their language was a natural first port of call when considering what I'd like to achieve. 
          </p>
          <p>
          I'm hoping that this site will evolve as I do, and can grow from just a lowly bug-ridden goal dump and become a portolio of sorts, containing all the evidence of my personal growth and serving as a beacon of hope for anybody else who feels like time was leaving them behind. 
          </p>
          <p>
          In conclusion, hi, I'm Savannah (or Tinkerknock, as I'm known online), and I'm working on this site. And myself. In 100 different ways.
