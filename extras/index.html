          I'm going to list all the resources and sources of support that have
          made any of this possible, but as a general note, not being a
          self-made woman extends throughout my entire life. I wouldn't be where
          I am today without my family, my wonderful mother, the opportunities
          I've been given, the schooling and further education I've recieved,
          and the life I've lived in general.
