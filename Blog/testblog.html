        <p>
          I'm hoping that if you've explored this far, you'll have a general idea of what this website is all about, but if you haven't: hello, I'm Savannah, and I've set myself a bunch of goals to help the person I am become to the person I want to be. (I shan't bother you with the full lore here, but you can always head over to my <a href="/About/abouthome.html">about me</a> page if you've some time to spend and an ability to overlook an untidy writing style.)
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
        As part of the website building process and in the interest of being as open and honest as possible about my progress, I wanted to leave behind a few snapshots of the website-building process. Not only so that I can look back and see where I came from, but so that whoever reads this in the future and feels inspired to do similar knows that it's gonna look a bit awful before it looks good. This will include my horrible sentence structure, half-understood coding ability, and general lack of design skill. I'm also writing this very passage at half 10 at night now and have well and truly lost the ability to form coherent English, and so I'll probably start winding up now and go play Animal Crossing in bed. But first, a little bit about my progress today - I've actually done a ton! 
        <p></p>
        <p>
        The little nav bar at the top, some work on the colours and background - whatever you see on this page will be exactly how I left it.T There may, however, be a minor change to the links etc if somehow I drastically improve navigation of the site and need to shove a link in here so that you can get back to civilisation. But other than that, the colours, the theme, the mess, it'll all be how the site looked at whatever time of night on Saturday 2nd August 2025. I can't even take credit for it all, as the little window-looking thing that this blog post is written in was made in about 12 seconds flat by my best friend after I started asking about the etiquette of webpage design and whether I should make it look like this though CSS or through pictures. After answering, I assume he thought just making me a template to fiddle with would be easier than dealing with the onslaught of follow-up questions that would inevitably ensue, of which he was absolutely right, it made my day and turning it pink was such a dream. Whilst I'm trying my best to code this thing from scratch, I'm finding that coding isn't something that really needs to be done from scratch. Sure, it's absolutely good to know <em>how</em> to, but there's so much help out there and SO many resources that even a basic understanding will get you further than you think. So, on this occasion, I shall just be content to steal my best friend's work and adopt it as my own. However, I did add a few pixels of padding to bring the text away from the sides a little and now it's thrown the whole format off, so I think that's where I'll leave the fiddling for tonight.  </p><p></p>
