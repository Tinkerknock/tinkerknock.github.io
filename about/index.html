            As you may already know, I'm Savannah, and I'd love to be able to succintly describe and introduce myself in a really simple way, like telling you my age, job title, and where I'm from. Whilst you now know that I'm somewhere over the age of 30, living in England, and working as a researcher, I'd also love to explain that I don't really feel like any of those things really give much away about who I actually am; they cover the when, where and the what, but not the why, how, or the hundreds of other threads that are constantly weaving and knotting to produce the tapestry of the life I live.
