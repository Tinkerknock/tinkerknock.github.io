        <p>
          Last year, I set myself a goal: think up 99 <em>more</em> goals, of
          which one should be 'create a website to house the goals', and work
          towards ticking them all off as part of my everyday life. I've since
          decided that not only will the website be the general hub for tracking
          the goals, but it'll also act as a portfolio for the more creative of
          those goals, serving as a one-stop-shop for everything Tinkerknock.
